What's up, guys. I was able to get th eserver to serve the HTML pages, or at least the immediately forward facing ones. I threw them on this branch for you to check out. I added some lines to the schema since we'll need folks to supply a photo url for their profiles. I haven't updated the form yet but that is easy to do tomorrow.
