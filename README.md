#Meetup 2 Eatup

The database is on Heroku (Thanks Mauricio) and I have the server pulling my HTML. 
I changed the home page up a bit, adding the login and signup to a navbar header. Each page will have a header where we can include quick links.

Things to do:

- make a handlebars version of layout for serving dynamic pages.
- make the questions pages a popup, this will be linked from the "matches" page and allow members to update the "food" and "location" values in DB.
